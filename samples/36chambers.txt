Shaolin shadowboxing, and the Wu-Tang sword style
If what you say is true,
The Shaolin and the Wu-Tang could be dangerous
Do you think your Wu-Tang sword can defeat me?

En garde, I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style

Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus

Ghostface, catch the blast of a hype verse
My glock bursts, leave in a hearse, I did worse
I come rough, tough like an elephant tusk
Ya head rush, fly like Egyptian musk
Aw shit, Wu-Tang Clan spark the wicks an'
However, I master the trick just like Nixon
Causin' terror, quick damage ya whole era
Hardrocks is locked the fuck up, or found shot
P.L.O. style, hazardous, cause I wreck this dangerous
I blow sparks like Waco, Texas

I watch my back like I'm locked down, hardcore
Hittin' sound, watch me act bugged, and tear it down
A literate type asshole, songs goin' gold, no doubt
And you watch a corny nigga fold
Yeah, they fake and all that
Carryin' gats but yo, my Clan
Rollin like forty Macs
Now ya act convinced, I guess it makes sense
Wu-Tang, yo suu, represent
I wait for one to act up
Now I got him backed up
Gun to his neck now, react what?
And that's one in the chamber
Wu-Tang banger, 36 styles of danger

Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus

I rip it hardcore, like porno-flick bitches
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards with biscuits
Check it, my method on the microphone's bangin'
Wu-Tang slang'll leave your headpiece hangin'
Bust this, I'm kickin' like Segal, Out For Justice
The roughness, yes, the rudeness, ruckus
Redrum, I verbally assault with the tongue
Murder one, my style shot ya knot like a stun-gun
I'm hectic, I wreck it with the quickness
Set it on the microphone, and competition get blown
By this nasty ass nigga with my nigga, the RZA
Charged like a bull and got pull like a trigga
So bad, stabbin' up the pad with the vocab, crab
I scream on ya ass like your dad, bring it on

Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus

Yo, I'm more rugged than slave man boots
New recruits, I'm fuckin' up MC troops
I break loops and trample shit, while I stomp!
A mud hole in that ass, cause I'm straight out the swamp
Creepin' up on site, now it's Fright Night
My Wu-Tang slang is mad fuckin' dangerous
And more deadly than the stroke of an axe
Choppin' through ya back swish
Givin' bystanders heart-attacks
Niggas try to flip, tell me who is him
I blow up his fuckin' prism
Make it a vicious act of terrorism
You want to bring it, so fuck it
Come on and bring the ruckus
And I provoke niggaz to kick buckets
I'm wettin' cream, I ain't wettin' fame
Who sellin' gain, I'm givin' out a deadly game
It's not the Russian it's the Wu-Tang crushin'
Roulette, slip up and get fucked like Suzette
Bring da fuckin' ruckus

Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus

So bring it on

Punk nigga!

Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga

Yo RZA, yo razor!

You could never capture the Method Man's stature
For rhyme and for rapture, got niggaz resigning, now master

Razor sharp, I sever 
the head from the shoulders, I'm better

Let's get together

(Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Wu buckwild with the tri-BLAOW!)

I react so thick, I'm phat, and YO!
Rae came blowing and blew off ya headphones black
Rap from yo Cali to Texas
Smoother than a Lexus, now's my turn to WRECK this
Brothers approach and half step, but ain't heard
HALF of it yet, and I bet you're not a fuckin vet
So, when you see me on the real, formin like Voltron
Remember I got deep like a Navy Seal!

[Chorus:]

(Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Wu buck wild with the trigger!
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
I'll FUCK YOUR ASS UP!)

Yo...!

Style from my vocal
Couldn't peep it with a pair of bi-focals
I'm no joker! Play me as a joker
Be on you like a house on fire! Smoke ya!
Crews be actin like they gangs, anyway
Be like, "Warriors! Come out and playiyay!"
Burn me, I get into shit, I let it out like diarrhea
Got burnt once, but that was only gonorrhea
Dirty, I keep shit stinks in my drawers
So I can get fzza-funky for yah
Murder, taste the flame of the Wu-Tang RAHH!
Here comes the Tiger verse Crane!
Ow, be like wild with my style
Punk! You playing me, chump, you get DUMPED

The RZA, the GZA, Ol Dirty Bastard, Inspectah Deck, you-God
Ghost Face Killer, the Method Man, Raekwon the Chef, the Master Killer
Raw Desire, LeVon, Power Cipher
Twelve O'Clock, Sixty Second Assassin, the 4th Disciple
The Brand White
K.D. the Down Low Wrecka, Shyheim AKA The Rugged Child
Doo-Doo Wales, Mista Hezakiah, better known as the Yin and the Yang
The Tru Masta, Asan, DJ Skane, The Tru Robocop comin' through
Scientific Shabazz, my motherfuckin' man Wise the Civilized
The Shaolin Soldiers, Daddy-O and Popa Ron
Comin' down from the motherfuckin' South end of things

Killa beez all over your fuckin' planet
Thirty-six chambers of death
Three-hundred and sixty degrees of perfected styles
Choppin' off your motherfuckin' dome
Peace, and every fuckin' borough
Crooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island
The motherfuckin' Bronx, killa beez

The sword?
come on, give him the sword

Clan in da front, let your feet stomp
Niggas on the left, brag shit to death
Now hoods on the right, wild for the night
Punks in the back, come on and attract to

The Wu is comin' through, the outcome is critical
Fuckin' wit my style, is sort of like a Miracle
On 34th Street, in the Square of Herald
I gamed Ella, the bitch caught a Fitz like Gerald-
Ine Ferraro, who's full of sorrow
'cause the hoe didn't win but the sun will still come out tomorrow
And shine shine shine like gold mine
Here comes the drunk monk, with a quart of Ballentine
Pass the bone, kid pass the bone
Let's get on this mission like Indiana Jones, the GZA
One who just represent the Wu-Tang click
With the game and soul, of an old school flick
Like the Mack and Dolemite, who both did bids
Claudine went to Cooley High and had mad kids
So stop, the life you save may be your motherfuckin' own
I'll hang your ass with this microphone
Make way for the merge of traffic
Wu-Tang's comin' through with Full Metal Jackets
God squad that's mad hard to serve
Come frontin' hard, then Bernhard Goetz what he deserves

Clan in da front, let your feet stomp
Niggas on the left, brag shit to death
Now hoods on the right, wild for the night
Punks in the back, come on and attract to

The response while I bomb that ass, "You ain't shit!"
Your wack ass town had you gassed
Egos is somethin' the Wu-Tang crush
Souped up niggas on a stage get rushed
I don't give a god damn, on the shows you did
How many rhymes you got, or who knows you kid?
'cause I don't know ya therefore show me what you know
I come sharp as a blade and I cut you slow
You become so Pat as my style increases
What's that in your pants ah human feces!
Throw your shitty drawers in the hamper
Next time come strapped with a fuckin' Pamper
How ya sound become? You're better off a quitter
I'm on the mound G, and it's a no-hitter
And my DJ the catcher, he's my man
Anyway he's the one who devised the plan
He throws the signs I hook up the beats with clout
I throw the rhymes to the mic and I strike em out
So it really doesn't matter on how you intrigue
You can't fuck with those in the major leagues

Clan in da front, let your feet stomp
Niggas on the left, brag shit to death
Now hoods on the right, wild for the night
Punks in the back, come on and attract to

Clan in da front, let your feet stomp
Niggas on the left, brag shit to death
Now hoods on the right, wild for the night
Punks in the back, come on and attract to

Niggas on the left, brag shit to death
Hoods on the right, wild for the night
Punks in the back, come on and attract to
Clan in da front, let your feet stomp

Take that motherfucker
Good morning Vietnam!
Yeah, good morning to all you motherfuckin' notty-headed niggas
Word to the camouflage large niggas
Bitch niggas fuckin' my body
Bring that fuckin' meth in here
Yo yo yo yo
Now we gonna drink some good night train
And yo, set it off

Champion gear that I rock, you get your boots knocked
Then attack you like a pit that lock shit down
As I come and freaks the sound, hardcore
But giving you more and more, like ding!
Nah shorty, get you open like six packs
Killer bees attack, flippin' what, murder one, phat tracks
Aight? I kick it like a night flite!
Word life, I get that ass while I'm fulla spite!
Check the method from bedrock, cause I rock ya head to bed
Just like rockin' what? twin glocks!
Shake the ground while my beats just break you down
Raw sound, we going to war right now

So, yo, bombin'
We usually take all niggas garments
Save ya breath before I bomb it

I be that insane nigga from the psycho ward
I'm on the trigger, plus I got the wu-tang sword
So how you figure that you can even fuck with mine?
Hey, yo, Rza! hit me with that shit one time!
And pull a foul, niggas save the beef on the cow
I'm milkin' this ho, this is my show, tical
The fuck you want to do? more than spike lee's do
I'm like a sniper, hyper off the ginseng root
Plo style, buddha monks with the owls
So who's the fucking man? meth-tical
On the chess box

Yo, yeah, yo
I leave the mic in body bags, my rap style has
The force to leave you lost, like the tribe of shabazz
Murderous material, made by a madman
It's the mic wrecker, inspector, bad man
From the bad lands of the killer, rap fanatic
Representing with the skill that's iller
Dare to compare, get pierced just like an ear
The zoo-we-do-wop-bop strictly hardware
Armed and geared cause I just broke out the prison
Charged by the system, for murdering the rhythm!
Now, lo and behold, another deadly episode
Bound to catch another fuckin' charge when I explode

Slammin' a hype-ass verse til ya head burst
I ram shack dead in the track, and that's that
Rap assassin, fastin', quick to blast and hard rock
I ran up in spots like fort knox!
I'm hot, top notch, ghost thinks with logic
Flashback's how I attacked your whole project
I'm raw, I'm rugged and raw! I repeat, if I die
My seed'll be ill like me
Approachin' me, you out of respect, chops ya neck
I get vexed, like crashing up a phat-ass lex'
So clear the way, make way, yo! open the cage
Peace, I'm out, jettin' like a runaway slave

Yo
Ya gettin' stripped from ya garments, boy, run ya jewels
While the meth got me open like fallopian tubes
I bring death to a snake when he least expect
Ain't a damn thing changed, boy, protect ya neck
Ruler zig zag, zig-allah jam is fatal
Quick to stick my wu-tang sword right through ya navel
Suspenseful, plus bein' bought through my utensil
The pencil, I break strong winds up against your
Abbot, that run up through your county like the maverick
Caps through the tablets, I gots to make the fabrics

Are you, uh, ah, uh
Are you a warrior? killer? slicin' shit like a samurai
The ol' dirty bastard vundabah
Ol' dirty clan of terrorists
Comin' atcha ass like a sorceress, shootin' that piss!
Niggas be gettin' on my fuckin' nerves
Rhymes they be kickin' make me want to kick they fuckin' ass to the curb
I got funky fresh, like the old specialist
A carrier, messenger, bury ya
This experience is for the whole experience
Let it be applied, and then drop that science

My my my
My clan is thick like plaster
Bust ya, slash ya
Slit a nigga back like a dutch master killer
Style jumped off and killa, hill-er
I was the thriller in the ali-frazier manilla
I came down with phat tracks that combine and interlock
Like getting smashed by a cinder block
Blaow! now it's all over
Niggas seeing pink hearts, yellow moons
Orange stars and green clovers

Started off on the island, AKA Shaolin
Niggas wilin', gun shots thrown, the phone dialin'
Back in the days of 8 now, making a tape now
Rae gotta get a plate now
Ignorant and mad young, wanted to be the one
Till I got (Blaow! Blaow! Blaow!) felt one
Yeah, my pops was a fiend since 16
Shooting that "that's that shit!" in his blood stream
That's the life of a grimey, real-life crimey
And niggas know that habit's behind me
Day one, yo, growing all up in the ghetto
Now I'm a weed fiend, jetting the Palmetto
In Medina, yo, no doubt the God got crazy clout
Pushing the big joint from down South
So if you're filthy stacked up
Better watch your back and duck
Cause these fiends, they got it cracked up
Now my man from up north, now he got the law
It's solid as a rock and crazy salt
No jokes, I'm not playing, get his folks
Desert Eagle his dick and put em in a yoke
And to know for sure, I got reck and rip shop
I pointed a gat at his mother's knot
Yo, Rae, don't do that shit, man! Don't do that shit!
Fuck that!

Dedicated to the winners and the losers
Dedicated to all Jeeps and Land Cruisers
(Can it be that it was all so simple then?)
Dedicated to the Y's, 850-I's
Dedicated to niggas who do drive-bys
(Can it be that it was all so simple then?)
Dedicated to the Lexus and the Ac's
Dedicated to MPV's: phat!

Kicking the fly cliches
Doing duets with Rae and A, happens to make my day
Though I'm tired of busting off shots, having to rock knots
Running up in spots and making shit hot
I'd rather flip shows instead of those
Hanging on my living room wall
My first joint, and it went gold!
I want to lamp, I want to be in the shade
Plus the spotlight, getting my dick rode all night
I want to have me a phat yacht
And enough land to go and plant my own sess crops
But for now it's just a big dream
Cause I find myself in the place where I'm last seen
My thoughts must be relaxed, be able to maintain
Cause times is changed and life is strange
The glorious days is gone, and everybody's doing bad
Yo, mad lives is up for grabs
Brothers passing away, I gotta make wakes
Receiving all types of calls from upstate
Yo, I can't cope with the pressure
Settling for lesser
The God left lessons on my dresser
So I can bloom and blossom, find a new way to
Continue to make more hits with Rae and A
Sunshine plays a major part in the daytime
Peace to mankind, Ghostface carry a black 9

Raw I'ma give it to ya, with no trivia
Raw like cocaine straight from Bolivia
My hip-hop will rock and shock the nation
Like the Emancipation Proclamation
Weak MC's approach with slang that's dead
You might as well run into the wall and bang your head
I'm pushing force, my force you're doubting
I'm making devils cower to the Caucus Mountains

Well I'm a sire, I set the microphone on fire
Rap styles vary, and carry like Mariah
I come from the Shaolin slum, and the isle I'm from
Is coming through with nuff niggas, and nuff guns
So if you wanna come sweating, stressing contesting
You'll catch a sharp sword to the midsection
Don't talk the talk, if you can't walk the walk
Phony niggas are outlined in chalk
I'm mad vexed, it's what the projects made me
Rebel to the grain there's no way to barricade me
Steamrolling niggas like a eighteen wheeler
With a drunk driver driving, there's no surviving

Rough like Timberland wear, yeah
Me and the Clan, and yo the Landcruisers out there
Peace to all the crooks, all the niggas with bad looks
Bald heads, braids, blow this hook
We got chrome Tecs, nickel plated Macs
Black Ac's, drug dealing styles in phat stacks
I only been a good nigga for a minute though
Cuz I got to get my props, and win it yo
I got beef wit commercial-ass niggas with gold teeth
Lamping in a Lexus eating beef
Straight up and down don't even bother
I got forty niggas up in here now, who kill niggas fathers

My peoples are you with me where you at?
In the front, in the back killa-bees on attack
My peoples are you with me where you at?
Smoking meth hitting cats on the block with the gats

Here I go, deep type flow
Jacques Cousteau could never get this low
I'm cherry bombing shits, Boom
Just warming up a little bit, vroom vroom
Rappining is what's happening
Keep the pockets stacked and then, hands clapping and
At the party when I move my body
Gotta get up and be somebody!
Grab the microphone put strength to the bone
Duh-Duh-Duh, enter the Wu-Tang zone
Sure enough when I rock that stuff
Guff puff? I'm gonna catch your bluff tuff
Rough, kicking rhymes like Jim Kelly
Or Alex Haley I'm a Mi-Beetle Bailey rhymes
Coming raw style, hardcore
Niggas be coming to the hip-hop store
Coming to buy grocery from me
Trying to be a hip-hop MC
The law, in order to enter the Wu-Tang
You must bring the Ol' Dirty Bastard type slang
Represent the GZA, Abbott, RZA, Shaquan, Inspectah Deck
Dirty Ol' getting low wit his flow
Introducing, the Ghostface Killah!
No one could get iller

My peoples are you with me where you at?
In the front, in the back killa-bees on attack
My peoples are you with me where you at?
Smoking meth hitting cats on the block with the gats

Speaking of the devil psych, no it's the God, get the shit right
Mega trife, and yo I killed you in a past life
On the mic while you was kicking that fast shit
You reneged tried again, and got blasted
Half mastered ass style mad ruff task
When I struck I had on Timbs and a black mask
Remember that shit? I know you don't remember jack
That night yo I was hitting like a spiked bat
And then you thought I was bugged out, and crazy
Strapped for nonsense, after me became lazy
Yo, nobody budge while I shot slugs
Never shot thugs, I'm running with thugs that flood mugs
So grab your 8 + 1, start flipping and tripping
Niggas is jetting I'm licking off son

Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang!

Homicide's illegal and death is the penalty
What justifies the homicide, when he dies?
In his own iniquity it's the
Master of the Mantis Rapture coming at ya
We have an APB on an MC Killer
Looks like the work of a Master
Evidence indicates that his stature
Merciless like a terrorist hard to capture
The flow, changes like a chameleon
Plays like a friend, and stabs you like a dagger
This technique attacks the immune system
Disguised like a lie paralyzing the victim
You scream, as it enters your bloodstream
Erupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain
Moving on a nigga with the speed of a centipede
And injure any motherfucking contender!

Tiger style
Yo, huh, huh
Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuttin Ta Fuck Wit
Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuttin Ta Fuck Wit
Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuttin Ta Fuck Wit
There's noplace to hide once I step inside the room
Dr. Doom, prepare for the boom
BAM! Aw, MAN! I SLAM
JAM, now scream like Tarzan

[Verse One: RZA]

I be tossin, enforcin, my style is awesome
I'm causin more Family Feud's than Richard Dawson
And the survey said -- ya dead
Fatal Flying Guillotine chops off your fuckin head
MZA who was that? Aiyyo, the Wu is back
Makin niggaz go BO BO!, like on Super Cat
Me fear no-one, oh no, here come
The Wu-Tang shogun, killer to the eardrum!

[Verse Two: Inspectah Deck]

I puts the needle to the groove, I gets rude
And I'm forced to fuck it up
My style carries like a pickup truck
Across the clear blue yonder
Seek the China Sea, I slam tracks like quarterbacks sacks from L.T.
Now why try and test, the Rebel INS?
Blessed since the birth, I earth-slam your best
Cause I bake the cake, then take the cake
and eat it, too, with my crew while we head state to state!

[Chorus: RZA]

And if you want beef, then bring the ruckus
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuttin ta fuck with
Straight from the motherfucking slums that's busted
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuttin ta fuck with

[Interlude: RZA]

Hyah!
Step up, boy!
Represent!
Chop his head off, kid!

[Verse Three: Method Man]

The Meth will come out tomorrow,
Styles, is wild, berserk, bizarro
Flow, with more afro than Rollo
Comin to a fork in the road which way to go just follow
Method, the Legend, niggaz is Sleepy Hollow
In fact I'm a hard act to follow
I dealt for dolo, Bogart comin on through
Niggaz is like "Oh, my God, not you!"
Yes, I, come to get a slice of the punk and the pie
Rather do than die, check my
flava, comin from the RZA
which is short for the razor
Who make me reminisce true like Deja, Vu!
I'm rubber, niggaz is like glue
Whatever you say rubs off me sticks to you

[Chorus]

[RZA]
Ahh-hah! Yeah
Representin Brooklyn Queens
Long Island, Manhattan Bronx
The Rugged Lands of Shaolin
Niggaz from Virginia, Atlanta
Our boys in Ohio

Yo, niggaz from The Source

Niggaz from Detroit, fuckin California squadron

Down in Maryland, all the way over there in Morgan State
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuttin ta fuck wit

Peace to the fuckin Zulu Nation
Peace to all the Gods and the Earths, word is bond
Wu-Tang slang, choppin heads boy
It ain't safe no more!

I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Staying alive was no jive
At second hands, moms bounced on old men
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo rockin' the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way, I begin to gee off was drug loot
And let's start it like this son, rollin' with this one
And that one, pullin' out gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen, who was a fiend
Started smokin' woolies at sixteen
And running up in gates, and doing hits for high stakes
Making my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed, for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off, and try to get the dough all
Sticking up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is ruff and tuff like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick ass click and went all out
Catchin' keys from across seas
Rollin in MPV's, every week we made forty G's
Yo nigga respect mine, or anger the tech nine
Ch-chick-POW! Wu from the gate now

Cash, Rules, Everything, Around, Me
C.R.E.A.M.

Dollar, dollar bill y'all

Cash, Rules, Everything, Around, Me

It's been twenty-two long hard years of still strugglin
Survival got me buggin, but I'm alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world cause shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make C.R.E.A.M.
Which failed I went to jail at the age of 15
A young buck sellin' drugs and such who never had much
Trying to get a clutch at what I could not, could not,
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacin' going up state's my destination
Handcuffed in back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so ruff
But as the world turns I learned life is hell
Living in the world no different from a cell
Everyday I escape from Jakes givin' chase, sellin' base
Smokin' bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed, and I ask what's it worth?
Ready to give up so I seek the Old Earth
Who explained working hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stickup kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks
And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be living proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth
But shorty's running wild smokin sess drinkin' beer
And ain't trying to hear what I'm kickin in his ear
Neglected, but now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
That what? That life is hectic

Cash, Rules, Everything, Around, Me
C.R.E.A.M.
Get the money
Dollar, dollar bill y'all

Cash, Rules, Everything, Around, Me
C.R.E.A.M.

And we gonna do it like this

I got, fat bags of skunk
I got, White Owl blunts
And I'm about to go get lifted
Yes I'm about to go get lifted

I got, myself a forty
I got, myself a shorty
And I'm about to go and stick it
Yes I'm about to go and stick it

Uhh
H-U-F-F huff and I puff
Blow like snow when the cold wind's blowin'
Zoom, I hit the mic like boom
Wrote a song about it like to hear it here it goes
Question what exactly is a pantie raider
Ill behavior savior or major flavor
All of the above oh yeah plus I do so
Also flam I'm the man call me super
Not an average Joe with an average flow
Doing average things with average hoes
Yo I'm super I'll make a bitch squirm
For my, Super Sperm (check it)
Check it I give it to ya raw butt naked
I smell sex pass the Method
Let's get lifted as I kick ballistics
Missiles and shoot game like a pistol
Clip is loaded when I click bang dang
A Wu-Tang slug hits your brain
J-U-M-P jump and I thump
Make girls rumps like pump and Humpty Hump
Wow, the Shaolin' style is all in me
Child, the whole damn isle is callin' me
P-A-N-T-Y R-A-I-D-E-R mad raw I don't cry
Meaning no one can burn or toss and turn me
Ooh I be the super sperm
Chim chimmeny chim chim cherie
Freak a flow and flow fancy free
Now how many licks does it take
For me to hit the Tootsie Roll center of a break
Peep and don't sleep the crews mad deep Wu-Tang
Fading motherfuckers like bleach
So to each and every crew
You're clear like glass I can see right through
You're whole damn posse be catchin' 'em all cause you vic'd
And ya didn't have friends to begin with
I'm

M-E-T, H-O-D, MAN
M-E-T, H-O-D, MAN
M-E-T, H-O-D, MAN
M-E-T, H-O-D, MAN

Here I am, here I am, the Method Man

Straight from the slums of Shaolin
Wu-Tang Killa Bee's on a swarm
(Your soul have just been taken through the 36 chambers of death, kid)

I smoke on the mic like smokin' Joe Frazier
The hell-raiser, raising hell with the flavor
Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan
Swinging through your town like your neighborhood Spiderman
So uhh, tick tock keep ticking
While I get you flipping off the shit I'm kicking
The Lone Ranger, code red: danger!
Deep in the dark with the art to rip the charts apart
The vandal, too hot to handle
You battle, you're saying Goodbye like Tevin Campbell
Roughneck, Inspectah Deck's on the set
The rebel, I make more noise than heavy metal

The way I make the crowd go wild
Sit back, relax won't smile
Rae got it going on pal, call me the rap assassinator
Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger
And I'mma get mad deep like a threat, blow up your project
Then take all your assets
Cause I came to shake the frame in half
With the thoughts that bomb shit like math
So if you wanna try to flip, go flip on the next man
Cause I grab the clip, and
Hit you with 16 shots and more, I got
Going to war with the melting pot, hot

It's the Method Man, for short "Mr. Meth"
Moving on your left
And set it off, get it off, let it off like a Gat
I wanna break, fool, cock me back
Small change, they putting shame in the game
I take aim and blow that nigga out the frame
And like Fame, my style will live forever
Niggas crossing over, but they don't know no better
But I do, true, can I get a "soo"
Enough respect due to the one-six-ooh
I mean ohh, yo check out the flow
Like the Hudson, or PCP when I'm dustin'
Niggas off, because I'm hot like sauce
The smoke from the lyrical blunt makes me eughck

Ooh, what, grab my nut, get screwed
Oww, here comes my Shaolin style
True B-A-ba-B-Y-U
To my crew with the "soo!"

C'mon baby baby c'mon baby baby c'mon baby baby c'mon

Yo, you best protect ya neck!

First things first, man, you're fucking with the worst
I'll be sticking pins in your head like a fucking nurse
I'll attack any nigga who slack in his mack
Come fully packed with a fat rugged stack
Shame on you when you stepped through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zu
And I'll be damned if I let any man
Come to my center, you enter the winter
Straight up and down, that shit packed: jam
You can't slam, don't let me get fool on him, man
The Ol' Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinking
Ason Unique rolling with the night of the creeps
Niggas be rolling with a stash
Ain't saying cash, bite my style I'll bite your motherfucking ass!

For crying out loud, my style is wild, so book me
Not long is how long that this rhyme took me
Ejecting styles from my lethal weapon
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon
Here's more again, catch it like a psycho flashback
I love Gats, if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
I come with shit that's all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stomping grounds
I give a order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shooting star
Cause who I are is livin' the life of Pablo Escobar
Point-blank as I kick the square biz
There it is, you're fucking with pros and there it goes

Yo chill with the feedback, black, we don't need that
It's 10 o'clock, ho, where the fuck's your seed at?
Feeling mad hostile, ran the apostle
Flowing like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy roll then attack the globe with the buck us style
The ruckus, 10 times 10 men committing mad sin
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fucking chin
Slaying boom-bangs like African drums
Coming around the mountain when I come
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My clan increase like black unemployment
Yeah, another one down, G-g-genius
Take us the fuck outta here

The Wu is too slammin' for these Cold Killin' labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doing artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's getting stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For trying to blow up a scrub
Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggas so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors, they're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R?
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar?
But he don't know the meaning of "dope"
When he's looking for a "suit-and-tie rap"
That's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter of fact, bring out the girls and let's have a mud fight

You best protect ya neck!
You best protect ya neck!
You best protect ya neck!
You best protect ya neck!

After laughter, comes tears

Yo check yo yo, check the script
Me and the gods get it ripped
Blunts in the dip, forty dogs in my lip
Had a box, 'Boom Boom' the bass will blast
We was laughing, at all the girls that passed
Conversation, brothers had begin to discuss
(Hey yo, Ra, remember that kid ya bust?)
Aw yeah, he ran, but he didn't get far
Cause I dropped him, heh heh heh heh heh ha!
Not knowin', exactly what lied ahead
My little brother, my mother sent him out for bread
Get the Wonder, it's a hot day in the summer
Didn't expect, to come across, a crazy gunner
"Hey Shorty, check it for the bag and the dough"
But he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said "No!"
Money splattered him, BOW! then he snatched the bag
In his pockets, then he jetted up the Ave.
Girls screamin', the noise up and down the block
(Hey, Rakeem!) What? (Your little brother got shot!)
I ran frantically, then I dropped down to his feet
I saw the blood, all over, the hot concrete
I picked him up, then I held him by his head
His eyes shut, that's when I knew he was
Aw man! How do I say goodbye?
It's always the good ones who have to die
Memories in the corner of my mind
Flashbacks, I was laughin' all the time
I taught him, all about the bees and birds
But I wish I had a chance to sing these three words

After laughter, comes tears

Me and my man, my ace big Moe from the shelter
Bout to hit the skins, from this girl named Thelma
Now Thelma had a rep, that was higher than her neck
Every girl from Shaolin dissed her respect
We was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed
Three o'clock in the morning, something gots to give
Moe said he'll go first, I said I'll take next
Here, take this raincoat, and practice safe sex
He seemed to ignore, I said be for real
She's not even worth it, to go raw deal
A man's gonna do what a man's gonna do
He got butt-naked and stuck the power you
Twenty minutes went by, my man went out, without a doubt
I'm not pumpin' up, I am, airin' you
Hey yo, he came out laughing with glory
I'm surprised, he's still livin', to tell his story
But he carried on, with the same old stuff
with Stephanie, like a whammy, he pressed his luck
Both tried to be down with O.P.P.
Ain't nothin' wrong but he got caught with the H.I.V. now
No life to live, doc says two more years
So after the laughter, I guess comes the tears

After laughter, comes tears
After laughter, comes tears
